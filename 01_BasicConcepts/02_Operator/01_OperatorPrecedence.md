# Operator Precedence

Here is the **operator precedence** for arithmetic operators in C++, from **highest** to **lowest**:

1. **`()`** - Parentheses (used to override the default precedence)
2. **`*` `/` `%`** - Multiplication, Division, Modulus (evaluated from left to right)
3. **`+` `-`** - Addition, Subtraction (evaluated from left to right)

Operators with higher precedence are evaluated before those with lower precedence. When operators have the same precedence, evaluation is done from left to right.
